#  Embedded Systems Simulation Projects (Proteus)

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems simulation projects built using **Proteus Design Suite** and programmed in **C**. The goal is to provide practical examples for learning and testing microcontroller-based systems without needing physical hardware.

## 📦 Included Modules

- ✅ **7-Segment Display** – Number counters, digit multiplexing
- ✅ **DC Motor Control** – Direction and speed control
- ✅ **16x2 Character LCD** – Displaying messages and dynamic data
- ✅ **Keypad Interface** – 4x4 matrix keypad input
- ✅ **EEPROM (I2C/SPI)** – Read/write data storage simulation
- ✅ **Interrupt Handling** – External interrupts with buttons
- ✅ **LED Control** – Blinking, toggling, and patterns
- ✅ **Push Button** – Digital input with debouncing
- ✅ **Relay Control** – Switching simulated AC/DC loads
